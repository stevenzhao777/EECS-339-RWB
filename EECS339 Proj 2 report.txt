In this project we implemented the requirements, as well as the additional extra credits.


For the extending query: we select from cycle before displaying the data, so the cycle table is always dynamic. Then we do "SELECT" according to what cycles are selected.


For Crowdsourcing : we implemented the basic functionality such as inviting users and one-time link by tracking the information about referrers and invitees.


For Aggregated view: we use SUM from NATURAL JOIN to select qualified data and set the color in javascript by calculating the difference.


For the bonus part:
# we implemented the encryption of password under LogIn function
# we also add the count for the contributions coming involved with Committees and Individuals
